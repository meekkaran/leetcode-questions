# A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

# Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

# The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.
# For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
